One important aspect is reducing the time and resources needed to train these models. In previous lessons, when importing the Santa images, you immediately reduced each image to an extremely pixelated 64x64 representation. On top of that, you further down-sampled the dataset to reduce the number of observations. This was because training neural networks is resource intensive and is often a time consuming process as a result. Typically you also want to improve the accuracy and performance of these models. In this lesson, you will begin to examine various techniques related to these goals, beginning with the discussion of validation sets.\n", "\n", "## Objectives\n", "\n", "You will be able to: \n", "\n", "- Explain the relationship between bias and variance in neural networks  \n", "- Explain how regularization affects the nodes of a neural network \n", "- Explain L1, L2, and dropout regularization in a neural network "]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Hyperparameters and iterative deep learning \n", "\n", "First, there are many hyperparameters you can tune.
