    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered the concept behind neural networks as well as some streamlined methods for building such models, we will begin to explore futher concepts involved in tuning and optimizing the performance of these networks. One important aspect is reducing the time and resources needed to train these models. In previous lessons, when importing the Santa images, we immediately reduces each image to an extremely pixelated 64x64 representation. On top of that, we further downsampled our dataset to reduce the number of observations. This was because training neural networks is resource intensive and is often a time consuming process as a result. Finally, not only do we wish to reduce production time, we also naturally want to improve the accuracy and performance of these models. In this lesson, we will begin to examine various techniques related to these goals, beginning with the discussion of validation sets.\n",
