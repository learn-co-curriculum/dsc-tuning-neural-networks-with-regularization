    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've learned about neural networks and some streamlined methods for building such models, it's time to further explore how to tune and optimize the performance of these networks. One important aspect is reducing the time and resources needed to train these models. In previous lessons, when importing the Santa images, you immediately reduces each image to an extremely pixelated 64x64 representation. On top of that, you further down-sampled the dataset to reduce the number of observations. This was because training neural networks is resource intensive and is often a time consuming process as a result. Typically you also want to also improve the accuracy and performance of these models. In this lesson, you will begin to examine various techniques related to these goals, beginning with the discussion of validation sets.\n",
